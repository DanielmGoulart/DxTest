# DxTest
My First Direct2d Project. It was made in early 2012, when i was learning about Direct2D and Windows API, so the code wont be in a good shape :).

A tiny 2d game based on Asteroids using only 2d primitives.

# Building Instructions
Requires Visual Studio 2012.

Just open the solution and build.
